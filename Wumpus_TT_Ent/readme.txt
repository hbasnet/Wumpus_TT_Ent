This project is to implement a knowledge base and inference engine for the Wumpus world. Wumpus world knowledge base is created using rules given. Finally, we should create an additional knowledge base and statement and on the basis of given knowledge base, the statement is definitely true or false, possibly true, possibly false, or both true and false must be determined.

According to wumpus rules given following knowledge base is created wumpus_rules.txt

To run a code:

time python check_true_false.py wumpus_rules.txt additional_kb.txt statement.txt

time python check_true_false.py a.txt b.txt c.txt

time python check_true_false.py d.txt f.txt e.txt

Note: all the required text files are present in same directory. Program prints knowledge base, statement, and recursion 
symbols list and model. And result is printed in result.txt file.
